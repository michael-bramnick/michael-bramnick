# 👋 Hi, I'm Michael Bramnick  
### Full-Stack Developer | AI Engineer | React • Next.js • Node.js • Django  

I’m a **Full-Stack Developer** who builds intelligent, scalable, and user-focused web applications that drive real business impact.  
With over **10 years of professional experience**, I specialize in bridging **AI innovation**, **modern web technologies**, and **human-centered design** to create digital products that are as *powerful* as they are *purposeful*.

I believe great engineering is more than code — it’s about creating systems that evolve, adapt, and empower users.

## 🧠 My Development Philosophy  

> “Write code that scales, design systems that last, and build products that matter.”

Every line of code should contribute to **clarity, performance, and usability**.  
I value **clean architecture**, **modular design**, and **data-driven decision-making** — whether I’m integrating AI models into workflows or refining microservices for better efficiency.
